[next to our logo] Mememoji is an interactive emotion recognition system that detects emotions based on facial expressions. The core of the app is a deep convolutional neural network that predicts the compositions of the emotions expressed by users. We hope you enjoy the special features we designed and give feedback to help us further train the algorithm. For the technology used behind the application, please visit: github.com/JostineHo/Mememoji.
